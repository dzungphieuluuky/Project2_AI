# Project2_AI: Wumpus World Agent
This is the second project in the course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence at HCMUS.

This project aims to build a Wumpus World Agent. The map in the world contains different traps and wumpuses that the agent has no idea about.

The inference rule in propositional logic is implemented to help the agent to navigate to safe positions and a search algorithm is used to guide the agent to the goal.
